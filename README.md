This is very beginning of the project, there are a lot of changes ahead.

### todo

- different types of cells
- custom cells
- intersection ofserver options
- custom loader

Probably many more features.

The goal of the project is build library which developer can use just add the library itself and attributes to corresponding tags. No framework or library dependency!
